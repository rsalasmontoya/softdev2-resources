This site contains a collection of lectures, assignments, and instructor materials for teaching software engineering or development, at an _intermediate_ level. It is assumed that students already know basic software engineering terms and skills. 

Materials are used for the [ITEC 3870 Software Development course sequence](https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/) taught at [Georgia Gwinnett College](https://ggc.edu). They were developed by [Cengiz Gunay](https://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/cengiz-gunay) and [Anca Doloc-Mihu](https://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/anca-doloc-mihu), supported by an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) grant at inception in 2019-2020 and by a continuation ALG grant for further development in 2020-2021.
